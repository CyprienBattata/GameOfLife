# game-of-life
An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in C.

## Installation


In order to run this program, you will need the SDL2 library installed globally on your system. The installation instructions are detailed here : https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation but using your system's package manager will make it very easy, I'm sure you can manage it all alone.

You will also need a C compiler, I used gcc, but feel free to modify the CC variable in the makefile to choose whatever compiler you want.

Then, just run : `$ make run` from the command line to launch the game and enjoy !

This project works on Unix-like operating systems by default, but if you're a Windows user, then use project inside WSL.
